## V6_pattern.c
This file contains the program code for generating a simple led blinking pattern that has the pattern of a v6 engine firing. This uses the built-in 6 leds and the HET Registor to perform the task.

## PWM_delay.c
This file contains the program code for generating a simple led blinking pattern that has the pattern of a v6 engine firing. This uses the built-in 6 leds and the HET Registor to perform the task.
The brightness control of leds are made possible by using the in-built timers with different duty cycles.

## SCI.c
This file contains the program code for sending a message interaction with a computer.
